### Introduction & Demands
Immigrant children who have family and sponsors in the United States are being detained as 
“unaccompanied alien children” in Chicago and the greater Chicagoland area. 

All detention centers in the area are and have been operated by the Chicago-based nonprofit 
organization **Heartland Alliance** (as of June, 2019). 
There are five currently operating detention centers administered by Heartland Alliance’s Human 
Care Services division under contract from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office 
of Refugee Resettlement in direct cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
There are typically between 300 and 400 children detained in these facilities at any given time. 
As of July 2018, 
[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-chicago-children-teens-immigration-shelters-heartland)
reported that, “of the more than 100 federally contracted sites 
around the country, Heartland has received the fourth-highest amount of federal dollars for 
housing unaccompanied minors since fiscal year 2015—more money than any other organization outside Texas.”
Heartland Alliance claims to be providing these children safe harbor. They hold that children who enter the 
country without an accompanying adult “have to go somewhere,” arguing that Heartland’s facilities 
are preferable to one of the larger-scale detention centers with more well-publicized horrifying conditions
like Tornillo (Texas) or Homestead (Florida). Although immigrant children were transported to these 
facilities against their or their families’ express wish and are being held at these facilities 
against their and their families’ will, Heartland describes these facilities as “shelters” instead of 
detention centers and claims that closing them would only further harm a population already under assault.
The organization is separating children from their families and loved ones under terms dictated by ICE and 
allied federal agencies. 

It risks the lives of the children and their families by collaborating directly with ICE.

### We demand that Heartland Alliance: 
1. Immediately **cease intaking migrant children** into their detention centers. 
2. Immediately **end their contract** with the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS) to detain migrant children.
3. **Release and reunify** the migrant children in their physical custody with their 
sponsors and families in the United States as soon as possible without sharing their sponsors’
biometric data, documentation status, or other personal information with ICE or with any federal 
agency that shares information with ICE.
4. Pledge to use their resources and power to **fight for a true detention-free, 
deportation-free, and ICE-free zone in Chicago**.
