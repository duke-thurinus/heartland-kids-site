# COVID-19 UPDATE
### On April 13th, ProPublica Illinois reported that Heartland Alliance is experiencing the largest COVID-19 outbreak in any detention facility for immigrant youth to date. Out of the 69 children Heartland is currently detaining, 37 children, as well as 2 employees at the detention center in Bronzeville have tested positive so far.

### Anticipating this kind of an outbreak is exactly why we demanded, a month ago, that Heartland close their detention centers and release the children to their families and sponsors. Many of these detained children arrive at the Heartland centers immunocompromised and with health problems as a result of their arduous journeys to the U.S. and their experiences with violence at the hands of ICE. 

### Our past interviews with former Heartland employees have revealed a pattern of refusal to give the child detainees adequate medical care. Even when Heartland was detaining 400 children at a time, there was only one doctor available to all 400 children. 

### This is a terrifying, potentially deadly situation. 

### There is absolutely no justification for Heartland’s continued operation of these detention centers. We demand that Heartland Alliance PERMANENTLY STOP all intake of children into their jails; REUNITE all of the children they currently detain IMMEDIATELY and WITHOUT collaborating with ICE (by collecting and sharing every child’s sponsors’ biometric information); that all infected children must be provided appropriate medication and a post-discharge treatment plan; and that all current detention center staff must be relocated within the organization.

## Introduction & Demands
Immigrant children who have family and sponsors in the United States are being detained as
“unaccompanied alien children” in Chicago and the greater Chicagoland area.

All detention centers in the area are and have been operated by the Chicago-based nonprofit
organization **Heartland Alliance** (as of June, 2019).
There are five currently operating detention centers administered by Heartland Alliance’s Human
Care Services division under contract from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office
of Refugee Resettlement in direct cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
There are typically between 300 and 400 children detained in these facilities at any given time.
As of July 2018,
[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-chicago-children-teens-immigration-shelters-heartland)
reported that, _“of the more than 100 federally contracted sites
around the country, Heartland has received the fourth-highest amount of federal dollars for
housing unaccompanied minors since fiscal year 2015—more money than any other organization outside Texas.”_
Heartland Alliance claims to be providing these children safe harbor. They hold that children who enter the
country without an accompanying adult “have to go somewhere,” arguing that Heartland’s facilities
are preferable to one of the larger-scale detention centers with more well-publicized horrifying conditions
like Tornillo (Texas) or Homestead (Florida). Although immigrant children were transported to these
facilities against their or their families’ express wish and are being held at these facilities
against their and their families’ will, Heartland describes these facilities as “shelters” instead of
detention centers and claims that closing them would only further harm a population already under assault.
The organization is separating children from their families and loved ones under terms dictated by ICE and
allied federal agencies.

It risks the lives of the children and their families by collaborating directly with ICE.

### We demand that Heartland Alliance:
1. Immediately **cease intaking migrant children** into their detention centers.
2. Immediately **end their contract** with the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) to detain migrant children.
3. **Release and reunify** the migrant children in their physical custody with their
sponsors and families in the United States as soon as possible without sharing their sponsors’
biometric data, documentation status, or other personal information with ICE or with any federal
agency that shares information with ICE.
4. Pledge to use their resources and power to **fight for a true detention-free,
deportation-free, and ICE-free zone in Chicago**.
