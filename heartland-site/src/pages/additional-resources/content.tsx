[Letter to David Sinski](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13DGkXr3_QdnCErm6Z5-upqfx4P5k74xZ)
- This is the letter that we delivered to David Sinski in person and electronically on June 17, 2019This is also the most comprehensive summary of why shutting down Heartland Alliance’s detention centers is in the best interest of the children detained in Chicago and of moving national policy. 

- Neither David Sinski, nor any other Heartland Alliance executive, have acknowledged that he has received this letter or made any reply. We sent this letter following several attempts to have a dialogue with Heartland Alliance. After a meeting on May 20 with David Sinski, Barbara Hoffman and Amy Rynell of Heartland Alliance, we were promised answers to questions they were unable to answer at that time. None of these Heartland Alliance executives have replied to our followup emails sent on May 23 and June 7.
