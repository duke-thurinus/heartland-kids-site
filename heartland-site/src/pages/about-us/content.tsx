### About Us
In July 2018, journalists from the
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigrant-children-held-in-shelters-they-told-us-to-behave-or-wed-be-here-forever/2018/07/14/635f4cee-86b4-11e8-8f6c-46cb43e3f306_story.html), 
[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-chicago-children-teens-immigration-shelters-heartland), 
and other media outlets began covering the abuses many children in Heartland detention centers experienced, the lasting trauma 
these children suffered from their detention, and the lack of accountability for many of the abuses 
they underwent. Some members of the Immigration Rights Committee (IRC) already knew that the shutdown 
of these detention centers would be an indispensable measure in any campaign to support those affected 
by detention — others of us were not sure where to stand.

Following protests at Heartland events and facilities by Chicago’s Little Village Solidarity Network
in November 2018, we began to conduct our own investigation into the history of child immigrant detention
in Chicago, its current state, and the division between those trying to make better detention centers 
and those fighting to shut down local detention centers. Now, almost a year after those initial exposés 
were published, we agree with Sandoval-Moshenberg’s warning: 

[“It takes a hell of a savior complex to really believe that a kid in your jail is better off than 
being with his family.”](https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-chicago-children-teens-immigration-shelters-heartland)

**We are convinced that an immediate end to child immigrant detention in the Chicagoland area is the only 
moral decision we can make**.
