# About Us
FreeHeartlandKids is an ongoing campaign of the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America which is part of a broader movement dedicated to shutting down child migrant detention centers in Chicago.

## We demand that Heartland Alliance:

1. Immediately cease intaking migrant children into their detention centers.
2. Immediately end their contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to detain migrant children.
3. Release and reunify the migrant children in their physical custody with their sponsors and families in the United States as soon as possible without sharing their sponsorsâ€™ biometric data, documentation status, or other personal information with ICE or with any federal agency that shares information with ICE.
4. Pledge to use their resources and power to fight for a true detention-free, deportation-free, and ICE-free zone in Chicago.

We are convinced that an immediate end to child immigrant detention in the Chicagoland area is the only moral decision we can make.
