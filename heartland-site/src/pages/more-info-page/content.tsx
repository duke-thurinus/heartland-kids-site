### Heartland & ICE
There is strong evidence of a close relationship and regular collaboration between Heartland Alliance and ICE. 
For example, Heartland’s public job postings explicitly advertise collaboration with ICE as an essential duty: 
A _“Swing Shift Mental Health Clinical Practitioner - Unaccompanied Children's Programs \\[…\\] Collaborates 
and serves as a primary contact for the Federal Field Specialist, the DUCS Field Coordinator and the Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement department as well as other voluntary agencies.”_ ProPublica reports: _“As caseworkers try
to find placements, the older teens live in fear of turning 18. Records show that immigration officials, almost
without fail, arrive on the children’s birthdays to take them into custody.”_ Crucially, in 2016, a Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) between DHS/ICE and ORR established information sharing between the agencies. Heartland has complied 
with these directives, which include fingerprinting sponsors and investigating their immigration status. This 
collaboration with ICE puts children and families in direct and urgent danger.

### Heartland's History
In 1888, American activist and social reformer Jane Addams founded the Chicago branch of 
Traveler’s and Immigrants Aid, a social welfare organization that would eventually transform 
into Heartland Alliance. Throughout its institutional history, Heartland Alliance has provided 
services to a variety of vulnerable populations. During the turn of the 20th century, Heartland 
Alliance worked to provide aid and transitional services to the rapidly growing population 
of new immigrant arrivals to the United States. Heartland Alliance workers also provided emergency 
first response services and housing support during the Great Depression and gave housing support 
and health care to HIV/AIDS patients during the early years of the Chicago AIDS epidemic. 
Since 1987, Heartland Alliance has been providing trauma-informed mental health services, 
translation, case management, and medical services for survivors of politically sanctioned 
torture and their families. Further, Heartland Alliance expanded their international trauma care 
work in 2003 and now maintains offices in nearly a dozen countries for the implementation of human rights programs.

### Following The Money
Heartland Human Care Services (HHCS), a division of Heartland Alliance, began receiving federal funding for unaccompanied child detention programs in 2014. This funding has trended upward as the number of children apprehended by ICE has done the same. Not only are increasing numbers of unaccompanied children crossing into the U.S., the Trump administration’s family separations and zero-tolerance border apprehensions are compounding the problem — a problem outsourced to institutions like Heartland and hidden in plain sight in our communities.

DHHS grants for the Unaccompanied Alien Children program (including post-detention wellness checks) accounted for 
[70% of Heartland Human Care Services' total revenue in 2017](https://taggs.hhs.gov/)
(the last year for which 990 filings are available). This amounts to roughly 25% of Heartland Alliance’s overall revenue. Prior to 2014, the Heartland Alliance for Human Needs and Human Rights was the recipient of these federal UAC program funds, receiving a total of $65.8 million over five years. Don’t let the term “nonprofit” confuse you: Heartland profits off of child detention. Considering the proportion of Heartland Alliance’s revenue dedicated to UAC detention, it is clear and indisputable that they monetarily benefit from child detentions.

Heartland received a staggering $40.2 million in federal grant money to operate these detention centers in 2017 alone. In 2018, that increased to $48.8 million. 
[And as federal grants have increased, so has Heartland executive pay](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/364053244).

In addition to this federal funding, Heartland Alliance receives state and municipal funds for unrelated programs. The city of Chicago has funded Heartland Alliance programs to the tune of $22 million over the past 4 years. Governor JB Pritzker’s personal foundation has also funded Heartland, giving at least half a million dollars to the organization in 2017 per Heartland’s annual report. Public money (or public figures’ money) demands public accountability.


### Damage of Child Detention
The American Psychological Association (APA) has 
[consistently](https://www.apa.org/news/apa/2018/border-family-separation)
and [repeatedly outlined](https://www.apa.org/advocacy/immigration/separating-families-letter.pdf)
the [psychological trauma](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-37283-001?_ga=2.266660809.696269440.1560289202-1480969999.1560289202)
inflicted by child detention and family separation and 
[advocates for its cessation.](https://www.apa.org/news/press/response/family-separation)

In a [statement issued in response](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2018/06/family-separation-policy)
to President Trump’s executive order ending the separation of children from their parents, 
Dr. Jessica Henderson Daniel,the president of the APA, reiterated that the psychological association 
*“remain\\\[s\\\] gravely concerned about the fate of the more than 2,300 children who have already been separated 
and are in shelters. These children have been needlessly traumatized and must be reunited with their parents
or other family members as quickly as possible to minimize any long-term harm to their mental and 
physical health. \\[...\\] This is not an acceptable policy to counter unlawful immigration.”* 

Many migrant children have already experienced profound trauma before they reach the United States. 
This trauma is then exacerbated by the family separation and detention process. Silvia M. Dutchevici, 
MA, LCSW, a member of Physicians for Human RIghts’ Asylum Network has interviewed many refugees who were 
separated from their parents. Dutchevici believes that most of the children will develop post-traumatic stress 
disorder and have difficulty forming healthy attachments. [Post-traumatic stress disorder can affect the physical 
chemistry of these children’s brains, causing them to produce higher levels of cortisol and norepinephrine in response
 to stressors](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/nurturing-self-compassion/201806/damage-separating-families?amp).

 A [5-year study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0743558410376830)
of 280 adolescent immigrant students in Boston and San Francisco showed that longer durations of
separation from parents led to [increased rates of anxiety and depression.  

Suzana Adams, PsyD, is a 
[clinical psychologist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/suzana-adams-psyd-llc-phoenix-az/97338)
who has [worked extensively](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/saras-demons-crossed-the-border-with-her-where-could-she-find-help-for-her-mental-health-problems-9040688)
with immigrant children who are housed in shelters. Adams reports that these children experience complex trauma 
and respond in some cases by urinating in their beds or displaying self-harming behaviors.
